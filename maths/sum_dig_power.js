/*
    The function sumDigPow takes two parameters, a and b, which represent the range of numbers to be checked.
    An empty array l is initialized to store the numbers that satisfy the condition.
    The function then iterates through the range from a to b using a for loop.
    For each number i in the range, it is converted to a string s.
    A variable c is initialized to store the sum of the powered digits.
    Another for loop is used to iterate through the digits of the current number i.
    For each digit, the function calculates its contribution by raising it to the power of its position (starting from 1) 
    using the Math.pow() function.
    The contribution of each digit is added to the c variable.
    After the loop, the function checks if the sum of the powered digits (c) is equal to the original number i.
    If the condition is true, the current number i is added to the l array.
    Finally, the function returns the l array containing the numbers that satisfy the condition.

The purpose of this function is to find all the numbers in the given range [a, b] where the sum of the digits raised to their respective positions is 
equal to the original number. These numbers are often referred to as "narcissistic" or "Armstrong" numbers.
For example, if you call sumDigPow(1, 100), the function will return an array containing the numbers [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 89], as these are the 
only numbers in the range [1, 100] that satisfy the given condition.

The code provided, which finds the numbers where the sum of the digits raised to their respective positions is equal to the original number (known as 
"narcissistic" or "Armstrong" numbers), can be applied in a few real-world scenarios:

    Detecting fraud in financial transactions:
        In the financial industry, credit card numbers and other account identifiers often follow specific patterns or rules.
        The sum of the digits raised to their respective positions can be used as a check to detect potentially fraudulent transactions.
        If the sum of the digits in a credit card number does not match the original number, it could be a sign of a fraudulent transaction, and the 
        system can flag it for further investigation.

    Verifying numerical identifiers:
        Many government-issued IDs, such as national ID numbers, social security numbers, or vehicle registration numbers, follow specific patterns.
        The sum of the digits raised to their respective positions can be used as a way to verify the validity of these numerical identifiers.
        If the sum of the digits in an ID number does not match the original number, it could indicate an invalid or tampered identifier.

    Error detection in data entry:
        When entering numerical data, such as product codes, inventory numbers, or customer IDs, there is a risk of human error.
        The sum of the digits raised to their respective positions can be used as a check to detect potential data entry errors.
        If the sum of the digits in an entered number does not match the original number, it could indicate a typing mistake or a data entry error, 
        prompting the user to double-check the input.

    Cryptographic applications:
        In certain cryptographic algorithms, the manipulation of numerical values, including the sum of the digits raised to their respective positions, 
        can be used as part of the encryption or decryption process.
        This technique can be employed in secure communication systems, digital signatures, or other cryptographic applications where the integrity of 
        numerical data is crucial.

By incorporating the logic from the provided code, developers can build applications or systems that leverage the concept of "narcissistic" or 
"Armstrong" numbers to enhance data validation, fraud detection, and overall data integrity in various industries and use cases.

// Function to check if a credit card number is valid
function isValidCreditCardNumber(cardNumber) {
  // Remove any non-digit characters from the card number
  cardNumber = cardNumber.replace(/\D/g, '');

  // Check if the card number is between 12 and 19 digits long
  if (cardNumber.length < 12 || cardNumber.length > 19) {
    return false;
  }

  // Calculate the sum of the digits raised to their respective positions
  let sum = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < cardNumber.length; i++) {
    let digit = parseInt(cardNumber.charAt(i));
    sum += Math.pow(digit, i + 1);
  }

  // Check if the sum matches the original card number
  return sum === parseInt(cardNumber);
}

// Example usage
let validCardNumber = '371449635398431';
let invalidCardNumber = '371449635398430';

console.log(isValidCreditCardNumber(validCardNumber)); // true
console.log(isValidCreditCardNumber(invalidCardNumber)); // false

/*In this example, the isValidCreditCardNumber function takes a credit card number as input and checks if it is a valid "narcissistic" or 
"Armstrong" number. Here's how it works:

    The function first removes any non-digit characters from the input card number using a regular expression.
    It then checks if the card number is between 12 and 19 digits long, as this is a common length range for credit card numbers.
    The function calculates the sum of the digits raised to their respective positions, similar to the code provided earlier.
    Finally, it checks if the calculated sum matches the original card number. If so, the function returns true, indicating a valid card number; 
    otherwise, it returns false.

In a real-world fraud detection system, this function could be integrated into the payment processing pipeline to validate the integrity of credit 
card numbers before authorizing a transaction. 
If the function returns false, the system can flag the transaction as potentially fraudulent and take appropriate actions, such as triggering additional 
verification steps or denying the transaction.

By incorporating this validation technique, the fraud detection system can leverage the properties of "narcissistic" or "Armstrong" numbers to enhance 
the overall security and reliability of the payment processing workflow.*/
