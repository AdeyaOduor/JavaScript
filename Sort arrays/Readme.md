A JavaScript program to get a sorted array of objects ordered by properties and orders.

    Uses Array.prototype.sort(), Array.prototype.reduce() on the props array with a default value of 0.
    Use array destructuring to swap the properties position depending on the order supplied.
    If no orders array is supplied, sort by 'asc' by default.
