// Example Usage

// Create a linked list with a loop: A -> B -> C -> D -> E -> C
const a = new ListNode('A');
const b = new ListNode('B');
const c = new ListNode('C');
const d = new ListNode('D');
const e = new ListNode('E');

a.next = b;
b.next = c;
c.next = d;
d.next = e;
e.next = c; // Creates a loop back to C

console.log(loopDetection(a) === c); // Output: true (loop starts at C)

// network monitoring tool that analyzes packet routes:
const routeA = new ListNode('Router A');
const routeB = new ListNode('Router B');
const routeC = new ListNode('Router C');
const routeD = new ListNode('Router D');

routeA.next = routeB;
routeB.next = routeC;
routeC.next = routeD;
routeD.next = routeB; // Creates a loop back to Router B

const loopNode = loopDetection(routeA);
if (loopNode) {
    console.log(`Loop detected at: ${loopNode.value}`); // Output: Loop detected at: Router B
} else {
    console.log('No loop detected.');

/*
Real-World Application: Detecting Cycles in Data Streams

One practical application of the loopDetection function is in monitoring and managing data streams, particularly in systems that process 
linked data structures such as real-time analytics, event processing, or network packets.
Use Case: Network Packet Analysis

In a networking context, data packets can traverse through nodes (like routers) in a network. If thereâ€™s a cycle in the routing paths due 
to misconfiguration, packets can get stuck in an infinite loop, leading to resource exhaustion and network congestion.

    Detecting Routing Loops:
        By representing the routing paths as a linked list, where each node represents a router and each link indicates the next router to which 
        a packet is sent, you can use the loopDetection function to identify if a packet is caught in a loop.

    Preventing Resource Exhaustion:
        Upon detecting a loop, the system can log the issue, alert network administrators, and take corrective actions, such as rerouting packets 
        or adjusting routing tables.
