// Example Usage

// Create a linked list with a loop: A -> B -> C -> D -> E -> C
const a = new ListNode('A');
const b = new ListNode('B');
const c = new ListNode('C');
const d = new ListNode('D');
const e = new ListNode('E');

a.next = b;
b.next = c;
c.next = d;
d.next = e;
e.next = c; // Creates a loop back to C

console.log(loopDetection(a) === c); // Output: true (loop starts at C)

// network monitoring tool that analyzes packet routes:
const routeA = new ListNode('Router A');
const routeB = new ListNode('Router B');
const routeC = new ListNode('Router C');
const routeD = new ListNode('Router D');

routeA.next = routeB;
routeB.next = routeC;

Real-World Application: Detecting Cycles in Data Streams

One practical application of the loopDetection function is in monitoring and managing data streams, particularly in systems that process 
linked data structures such as real-time analytics, event processing, or network packets.
1. Network Packet Analysis

In a networking context, data packets can traverse through nodes (like routers) in a network. If thereâ€™s a cycle in the routing paths due 
to misconfiguration, packets can get stuck in an infinite loop, leading to resource exhaustion and network congestion.

    Detecting Routing Loops:
        By representing the routing paths as a linked list, where each node represents a router and each link indicates the next router to which 
        a packet is sent, you can use the loopDetection function to identify if a packet is caught in a loop.

    Preventing Resource Exhaustion:
        Upon detecting a loop, the system can log the issue, alert network administrators, and take corrective actions, such as rerouting packets 
        or adjusting routing tables.

2. Real-Time Analytics System

In a real-time analytics environment, data flows continuously from various sources (like sensors, user interactions, or streaming data platforms). The system processes this data to generate insights, monitor performance, or trigger alerts. However, if there are cycles in data processing paths (such as repeated processing of the same data), it can lead to inefficiencies or incorrect analytics results.
Key Steps to Implement Loop Detection

    Data Structure Design:
        Represent the data flow as a linked list or graph where each node represents a processing step (like data ingestion, transformation, or aggregation), and edges represent the flow of data between these steps.

    Integrate Loop Detection:
        Use the loopDetection function to monitor the data processing paths in real time. You can periodically check for cycles in the data flow.

    Trigger Alerts:
        If a loop is detected, the system can trigger alerts or logs to notify administrators, allowing for quick intervention.

    Prevent Resource Exhaustion:
        Upon detecting a loop, the system can automatically reroute data, skip the problematic processing step, or restart the data pipeline.

// Step 1: Define the Data Flow
class ProcessingNode {
    constructor(name) {
        this.name = name;
        this.next = null;
    }
}

const createDataFlow = () => {
    const nodeA = new ProcessingNode('Ingest Data');
    const nodeB = new ProcessingNode('Transform Data');
    const nodeC = new ProcessingNode('Aggregate Data');
    const nodeD = new ProcessingNode('Store Data');

    // Create a loop for demonstration: Store Data -> Transform Data
    nodeA.next = nodeB;
    nodeB.next = nodeC;
    nodeC.next = nodeD;
    nodeD.next = nodeB; // Creates a loop back to Transform Data

    return nodeA; // Return the head of the linked list
};
